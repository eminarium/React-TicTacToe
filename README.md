The base project was developed based on React page tutorial at https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html

Besides developing the base project, extra functionality was added. Extra functionalities are :

1. Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
2. Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
3. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
4. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
5. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
6. When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
